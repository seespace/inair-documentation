========================

As InAiR Activity (`IAActivity`) subclasses Android Activity, understanding [Android Activity lifecycle](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/activity-lifecycle/index.html) is mandatory. 

Below is lifecycle callback methods comparion between 2 platforms:

| Android Activity | InAiR Activity   |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `onCreate()`     | `onInitialize()` |
| `onStart()`      | Not Available    |
