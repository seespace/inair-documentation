Creating an InAiR Project
=========================

An InAiR project contains all the files that comprise the source code for your InAiR app. The InAiR SDK tools make it easy to start a new InAiR project with a set of default project directories and files.

This lesson shows how to create a new project using Android Studio.

>**Note:** You should already have the Android SDK and Android Studio installed, if not follow the  Google's guide to [Installing the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) before you start this lesson.


Install InAiR App Generator
---------------------------
Although sharing lots of common libraries, InAiR Apps are quite different from a traditional Android Apps. Only Apps developed using our SDK will appear on our launcher. To make the process easier, we've provided [InAiR App Generator](Airman.md) for you to quickly start your development.




Your InAir project is now a basic "Hello World" app that contains some default files. To run the app, continue to the next lesson.
