An InAiR project contains all the files that comprise the source code for your InAiR app. The InAiR SDK tools make it easy to start a new Android project with a set of default project directories and files.

This lesson shows how to create a new project using Android Studio.

>**Note:** You should already have the Android SDK and Android Studio installed, if not follow the  Google's guide to [Installing the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html) before you start this lesson.


###Install InAiR App Template for Android Studio

As you continue developing apps, you may need to install additional versions of Android for the emulator and other packages such as the Android Support Library. To install more packages, use the SDK Manager, which you can open from Android Studio by clicking SDK Manager  in the toolbar.
