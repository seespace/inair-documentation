###Overview
The `UIListView` presents a control that use to display a collection of data that scrolls vertically.

By default, a data item is displayed in the `UIListView` as the string representation of the data object it's bound to. To specify exactly how items in the `UIListView` are displayed, you create a `DataTemplate` to define the layout of controls used to display an individual item. The controls in the layout can be bound to properties of a data object, or have content defined inline. You assign the `DataTemplate` to the `ItemTemplate` property of the `UIListView`. Figure 1 shows an example of `UIListView`.
