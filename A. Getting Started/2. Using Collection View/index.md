###Overview
A collection view facilitates the presentation of data-driven views provided by your app. The collection viewâ€™s only concern is taking your views and laying them out in a specific way. The collection view is all about the presentation and arrangement of your views and not about their content.

With current version of inAiR-SDK we have `three` collection views `UILayeredNavigation`, `UIListView` and `UIMenuView`.

###First touch
When using a collection view, first thing you maybe wonder how can we set data source for this collection or can we have diffirent view for diffirent type of data? The anwser for you question is two properties which is contained in all our collection view `ItemsSource` and `ItemTemplate`

> An example of using Collection view in layout xml file
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<UILayeredNavigation
  xmlns:ui="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
  ui:itemsSource="{ Binding Path='viewItemsSource' }"
  ui:itemTemplate="@layout/layered_datatemplate"
/>
```

* The `ItemsSource` property stands for data source of collection view and need to be a list of items view model.

> If you want your collection auto update when you item source changes (such as add more item, delete item, ...) `ItemsSource` must be an ObservableCollection ~ a java list that will raise event when collection changed.

* The `ItemTemplate` property stands for template view for each item view when it populates from data source. `ItemTemplate` must be an xml file which contain a `DataTemplate` element.

> `DataTemplale` is an object that definds a relationship between a layout view, presenting by `templateId` attribute, and a data tag, presenting by `templateTag`.
A simple datatemplate file
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<MutilDataTemplate xmlns:ui="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
    <DataTemplate
        ui:templateId="@layout/first_layout"
        ui:templateTag="firstlayer"/>
    <DataTemplate
        ui:templateId="@layout/second_layout"
        ui:templateTag="secondlayer"/>
</MutilDataTemplate>
```
