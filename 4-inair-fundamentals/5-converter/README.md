Data Binding Converter
===

Converter performs two way conversion between ViewModel's property and UI component attribute value. It converts data to component attribute when loading ViewModel's property to components and converts back when saving to ViewModel. It's quite common requirement to display data in different format in different context. Using converter developers can achieve this without actually changing the real data in a ViewModel.
